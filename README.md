# Just Juice

## Problem Domain 

Currently our business owner Octavio does not have a website for his company Just Juice. He would like his customers and prospective customers to be able to interact with them online so that the customers can understand who they are as a business and the services they provide. Octavio also wants his customers to be able to add his juices to a cart for later purchase. As well, he would like for his customers to be able to create their own juice blend. Our goal as a team is to  develop a website that showcases his juices and also allows the site visitor to add their juices to a cart for purchase.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to have a home page with a featured section displaying the top 3 juice options.

- As a user I want to have a buttons on the home page that lead to all the other pages on the website.

- As a user I want a page that displays a catalog of all juice options where the options are clickable and can add to the cart.
